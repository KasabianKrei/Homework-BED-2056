```{r plot}
plotBED(dframe$date, dframe$guestNights2018, xlab = "Month", ylab = "N. Of Guests", main="Evolution of Guests per month")
```


In 2018 -as evidenced in the graph above- the month with more guests per night was  **`r format(as.Date(dframe[which.max(dframe$guestNights2018),1]), "%B")`**, with a total ocupation of **`r dframe[which.max(dframe$guestNights2018),2]`** nights enjoyed by guests. This information can be seen as well in the table *below*.
