#Insert plot from dataframe
```{r}
plotBED(dframe$date, dframe$guestNights2018,
     xlab="Month", ylab="Total guest by month", main="Development of occupancy"
)
```

From the plot above its illustrated that the month with most guests per night was
**`r format(as.Date(dframe[which.max(dframe$guestNights2018),1]), "%B")`**. The total occupancy for the month was
**`r dframe[which.max(dframe$guestNights2018),2]`**.

## Table of the data
```{r}
knitr::kable(dframe)
