![Tromso by night](./picture/tromso_by_night.png)

```{r plot}
plotBED(df$date, df$guestNights2018,
        xlab = "Month", ylab = "N Guests", main="Guests per month")
```



The month with the highest amount of guests was  **`r format(as.Date(df[which.max(df$guestNights2018),1]), "%B")`**, with **`r df[which.max(df$guestNights2018),2]`** nights in total. This information can be seen as well in the table *below*.

```{r}
knitr::kable(df, col.names = c("Date", "N nights"))
