## Number of hotel stays in 2018

```{r plot_chunk}
plotBED(dframe$Date, dframe$guestNights2018, main = "Number of Guests by Month in 2018", xlab = "Month", ylab = "Number of Guests")

```

The month with the most guests in 2018 was `r months(dframe[which.max(dframe$guestNights2018), 1])` with a total of `r max(dframe$guestNights2018)` stays.

```{r table_chunk}
knitr::kable(dframe, col.names = c("Date", "Number of Guests"))

```
