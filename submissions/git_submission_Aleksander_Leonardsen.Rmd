<!-- I used a few of the other assignments to see how to import data from git. And code from class and stack overflow.  -->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

![Tromso by night](picture/tromso_by_night.png)

## Nerstranda by night. 



## Guest stays. 
```{r, include=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
plotBED(y=dframe$guestNights2018, x=dframe$date, ylab="Guests stays", xlab="Date") 
title ("Guest per night Tromso 2018")
```
The month with the highest number of guests spending the night was `r format(as.Date(dframe[which.max(dframe$guestNights2018),1]), "%B")` with `r dframe[which.max(dframe$guestNights2018),2]`

## Table of data.

```{r}
knitr::kable(dframe)
```
