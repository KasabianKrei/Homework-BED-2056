```{r guestPlot}
plotBED(dframe$date, dframe$guestNights2018, xlab="Month", ylab="Guests", main="Plot of guests per month in 2018. ")
```

```{r maxGuestMonth}
maxGuest <- max(dframe$guestNights2018)
maxGuestMonth <- which(dframe$guestNights2018 == maxGuest)
```

The month with the highest number of guest nights in 2018 was `r month.name[maxGuestMonth]`, which had `r maxGuest` guests.

```{r guestTable}
knitr::kable(dframe, col.names = c("Date", "Guests"), align = 'l', caption="Table of guests per month in 2018")
