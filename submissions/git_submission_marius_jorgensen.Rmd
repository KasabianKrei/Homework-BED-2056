<h3>Number of guest nights in 2018</h3>
```{r}
plotBED(dframe$date, dframe$guestNights2018, xlab="Month", ylab="Number of guest nights")
```
```{r}
# Get the row in the dataframe with max guests
dframe_max_guests_row <- dframe[which.max(dframe$guestNights2018),]

# Get the number of guests
guest_num <- dframe_max_guests_row[1, "guestNights2018"]

# Get the name of the month
date <- dframe_max_guests_row[1, "date"]
month <- months(as.Date(date))
```

<p>`r month` was the month with the most number of stays. The number of stays in `r month` was `r guest_num`.</p>

<h3>Data</h3>
