## Guest nights in Troms county, 2018

```{r plot}
plotBED(dframe$date, dframe$guestNights2018,
        xlab="2018", ylab="Guest Nights") # x and y text
```


```{r dynamic_text}
maxGuestNights <- max(dframe$guestNights2018) # captioning highest number
maxGuestsDate <- as.Date(dframe[dframe$guestNights2018==maxGuestNights, "date"]) # captioning the date connected to the highest number 
```

The month with the highest activity is `r format(maxGuestsDate, "%B")`. The total number of guest nights is `r format(maxGuestNights, big.mark=" ")`.


```{r table_setup}
dframe$date <- as.Date(dframe$date) # as date to collect text variable of the month
dframe$date <- months(dframe$date) # assigning name of which month to dframe
dframe$guestNights2018 <-  format(dframe$guestNights2018, big.mark = " ") # present numbers with space between thousands
colnames(dframe) <- c("Month", "Guest Nights") # changing names for table presentation
```


```{r table}
kable(dframe, row.names = FALSE, align = 'c')# Creating a table 
```
